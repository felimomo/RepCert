Run certificate on random irreducible subrepresentations (obtained using RepLAB)
of the primitive rep of S2 \wr S7 obtained from the natural rep of S7. 

In the language of replab: G = s2.wreathProduct(s7), rep = G.primitiveRep(s7.naturalRep).
The global dimension is 49, the Cayley diameter is 25^2 = 625. I'm using the
'super-short walk' ad-hoc formula, where the 2t_min is chosen to be the Cay Diam, and
t_max = t_min + 100.

Decomposition = C(1) + C(12) + C(36)

IrrD = irrep dimension, Samp = max number of samples needed, Cert = did the full certificate work?
Inv = precision of invariance certificate, CertTime = time needed for certificates.
